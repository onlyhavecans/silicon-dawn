# Silicon Dawn

I made this so I can pull random cards on my phone and review the text.

There is also a [nightly rust version branch](https://onlyhavecans.works/amy/silicon-dawn/src/branch/nightly) of this I am testing out with [rocket](https://rocket.rs/) and [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

## Instructions

Pythonista isn't the BEST experiance I found, so I wrote a web daemon you can compile it and run it wherever you want.
Becasue everything is best as a web page (?question mark?)

1. [install rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.29.0/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
1. `make` to run the daemon
1. Browse to http://localhost:3200 to enjoy your pick
1. Refresh the page for a fresh pick

Or! if you are super lazy check out [my hosted copy of this](https://silicon-dawn.cards).
