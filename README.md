# Silicon Dawn

I made this so I can pull random cards on my phone and review the text.

I also want to make a card reference out of this as well.

I designed this for use in [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) but it's basic enough to be portable

## Instructions

1. Run `pipenv install` if running on a computer to pull deps
1. Run `get.py` if you don't have the cards yet
1. Run `pick.py` to get a random card and description
